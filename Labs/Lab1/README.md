Although HTML is old, it is still iportant to know how to create pages with it.</br>
Without a basic understanding of what HTML is, it would be difficult to see how frameworks like React work under the hood.</br>
Personally, working with HTML as a beginner is frustrating because of the lack of knowledge of basic tags.</br>
However, after learning the tags, creating html pages from scratch became more managable.
