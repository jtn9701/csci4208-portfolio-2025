# Reflections
This javascript basics lab, in my opinion, was really helpful.</br>
It reminded me that basic code architecture can and should be modular.</br>
For example, splitting the hi-lo game using the model-view-controller (MVC)</br>
paradigm kept key components of the game separate making the project feel cleaner.
