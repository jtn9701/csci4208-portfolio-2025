This oop javascript lab was very useful in learning good</br>
oop practices when it comes to making front-end projects.</br>
The lab also gives me good insight on how a basic project</br>
should be structured.</br>
Some problems I faced during this lab was the inconsistencies</br>
in variable names. The code would run correctly many times without</br>
giving error messages, so debugging was tougher than usual as well.
