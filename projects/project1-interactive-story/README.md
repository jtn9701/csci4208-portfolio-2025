## Techniques used
- HTML (multi-page), CSS (external stylesheets)
- For the majority of our standard buttons, we decided to use CSS styled anchor tags</br>
with CSS styling to match the aesthetic of the game.</br>
- For some of the complex scripts, we abstracted them into their own .js files</br>
to make the HTML files feel cleaner
