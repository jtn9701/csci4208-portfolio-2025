## Idea Summary
A problem we've seen/experienced is the inablility to easily find UNO clubs and events.</br>
We will be making an App that holds information about all of UNO's clubs and events.</br>
At a very basic level, the App will act as a calendar app that houses data on all school events.</br>
This app will allow students/faculty find out about clubs/events more easily.</br>
A feature of this app wil be to allow admins/users with special permissions to add to the calendar for everyone to see></br>
